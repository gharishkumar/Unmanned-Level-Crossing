The main objective of this project is to design and implement a smart traffic control system.
The timing scheme that is to be demonstrated promises an improvement in the present train
traffic system. This system is affordable and ready to be installed especially during peak
hours and in the unmanned level crossing system. In our project, Raspberry pi is used and it is
interfaced with IR(InfraRed) sensors. The railway gate closes before 5 minutes to the arrival of
train and it automatically opens after the train leaves. This system could be more efficient in
remote areas.
